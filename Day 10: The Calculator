Day 10 of hashtag#100DaysofCode just wrapped up. I gotta say... I spent a good amount of time today going over notes after hitting the meat of today's topic, functions with outputs. My poor wife got a crash course in me explaining everything so far.. her eye only twitched a few times. 😬 Bless her heart!

That was much needed to recall though, so glad she let me nerd out!

It was such a "brain-burner" focusing on all that and then the power of the return statement.

The TL;DR on today's grind:
✅ Return vs. Print: Learned how to make functions actually "hand back" data so it can be used elsewhere, rather than just displaying it.
✅ Multiple Return Statements: Using logic to exit functions early based on specific conditions (guard clauses).
✅ Recursion & Flag Variables: Figuring out how to keep a program running based on user input or even having a function call itself.

The Project: A Recursive Calculator 🔢 I built a full-function calculator that can perform continuous operations. The real challenge was managing the logic that allows a user to keep performing calculations on the previous result or start a brand-new one from scratch.

My brain is officially fried, but the logic is starting to feel second nature. Time to step away from the screen! ☕️💤




import art

def add(n1, n2):
    return n1 + n2

def subtract(n1, n2):
    return n1 - n2

def multiply(n1, n2):
    return n1 * n2

def divide(n1, n2):
    return n1 / n2

operations = {
    "+" : add,
    "-" : subtract,
    "*" : multiply,
    "/" : divide,
}
def calculator():
    print(art.logo)
    performing_operations = True
    n1 = float(input("Enter a number: "))

    while performing_operations:
        for symbol in operations:
            print(symbol)
        operator = input("Enter an operator: ")
        n2 = float(input("Enter another number: "))
        result = operations[operator](n1, n2)
        print(f"{n1} {operator} {n2} = {result}")

        performing_operations = input(f"Continue calculating with {result} (y/n)?: ").lower()
        if performing_operations == "y":
            n1 = result
        else:
            performing_operations = False
            print("\n" * 30)
            calculator()

calculator()
