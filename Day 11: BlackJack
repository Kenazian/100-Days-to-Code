Day 11 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode is in the books. All I can say is wow... excuse me while I go throw down a few ibuprofen, because my brain is inflamed!

Today was a big achievement despite the pounding headache. A test of everything learned so far to make a fully functional blackjack game.

Why this was a level-up: Instead of learning a new tiny syntax trick, I had to architect a complex game flow from scratch. This required:
🃏 Complex Game Logic: Handling the dealer’s hits vs. the player’s choices.
❗ The "Ace" Problem: Writing logic to dynamically change an Ace's value from 11 to 1 if the total score exceeds 21.
🔄 State Management: Tracking cards, scores, and win/loss conditions simultaneously.
🍝 Clean Code: Using functions to keep the game "re-playable" without the code turning into spaghetti.

This project showed the difference between "knowing" what a while loop is, and knowing how to use it to control a complex user experience. Took a lot of debugging and tests, but seeing it all come together and challenging myself was incredibly rewarding. Especially when everything just comes together and works seamlessly.

Oh goodness, is it time for supper now? Spaghetti anyone? 🤪
