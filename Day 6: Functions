Day 6 had everything to do with functions. Defining, calling, hurdles, and loops.
This day of learning was spent in Reeborgs world, tackling different challenges.
Standard hurdles, hurdles while looping, hurdles with various heights and lengths, and automating the code to continue until reaching the destination while ensuring no infinite loops occur.
The importance if indentation was solidified on top of the other items covered.
Final challnege, help Reeborg escape a maze, applying all the different learned material.
