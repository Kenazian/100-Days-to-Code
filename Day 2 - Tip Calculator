Day 2 Task - Create a "Tip Calculator"

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
# User inputs bill amount
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $ "))
# User inputs desired tip percentage as an integer
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? Enter percentage: "))
# Tip percentage is calculated for the user
tip = tip / 100.0
# Tip is applied to bill with total displayed to user
total = round((bill * tip) + bill, 2)
print(total)
# Input how many people are splitting, if any, and performs arithmetic.
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
total = total / people
# Prints total for each person, rounded to two decimal places.
print(f"Each person should pay: ${round(total, 2)}")
